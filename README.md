# 🐱🐶 Cat vs. Dog Classifier App  

This project is a fun yet practical **image classification app** built with **Streamlit** and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
It allows users to upload an image and instantly get a prediction: **Cat or Dog** 🐾.  

---

## 📊 What’s Inside
- A **Streamlit app** (`app.py`) that provides a clean web interface.  
- A **CNN model** trained on the classic Cats vs. Dogs dataset.  
- Utilities for **image preprocessing** and real-time prediction.  

---

## 🚀 What I Did
- **Preprocessed images**: resized, normalized, and augmented them for robust training.  
- **Built a CNN** from scratch (using TensorFlow/Keras) to learn distinguishing features.  
- **Trained & validated** the model on thousands of cat and dog images.  
- **Integrated with Streamlit** so anyone can use the classifier in their browser.  

---

## ⚖️ What It Compares
- Shows how **deep learning (CNNs)** outperforms simpler models in image classification.  
- Demonstrates the bridge between **machine learning research** and a **usable product**.  

---

## ✅ What Comes Out at the End
- A user-friendly **web app** where you can upload a photo and get a prediction in seconds.  
- Achieved **high accuracy** on the validation set with CNNs.  
- Proof that ML models can be deployed for **real-time, interactive use cases**.  

---

## 🎯 Value of the Project
- End-to-end workflow: **data → model → deployment**.  
- Showcases skills in **deep learning, computer vision, and app development**.  
- Makes machine learning accessible in a **simple, interactive app**.
